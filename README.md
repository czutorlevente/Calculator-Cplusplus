# Overview

As I was learning to use C++, I wrote a Calculator program that is able to add numbers up, substract numbers from each other, 
multiply numbers, divide numbers, and perform exponentation. It contains classes and several functions. It writes previous calculations into strings, and saves those strings into a memory text file, which can be useful when performing multiple calculations for a task, because we don't have to repeat calculations if we forgot the results.
Also a little fun thing is that the program will greet us based on the current time, like "Good Morning!" or "Good Evening!" etc.

# Development Environment

I watched YouTube videos about C++, and asked chat GPT a lot to help me with portions of the tasks. It could not solve everything though, but was very helpful. I also referred to previous programs of mine that I wrote in C#, that used similar logic. 

I used C++ and included several libraries:
 <iostream>
 <stdexcept>
 <cmath>
 <stdexcept>
 <ctime>
 <fstream>
 <string>

# Future Work

- I did not have enough time at the end, but next time I would figure out a way to not show all the zeros at the end of double numbers.
- I would divide my work up to more classes and functions. The "manage_calculator.h" class became way too long and hard to manage.
- Become better at managing exceptions and handling errors. A lot of time went away figuring out those.
